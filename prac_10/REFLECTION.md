# Reflection

###regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during
the course of the subject?

- Honestly, the estimate is always shorter than the actual work.The estimation does get better.
  ###regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
- By performing code reviews, I get to see different coding styles, which helps me explore cleaner code. Additionally,
  it creats interactions between classmates. Some people provide great advices. Overall, this exercise helps with coding
  improvement.
  ###regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
- Perhaps add a couple of extra exercises.
